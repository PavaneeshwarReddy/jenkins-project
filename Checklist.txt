1. Install Jenkins Container
	- Create a jenkins.yaml file
	- Configure the ports, volumes

2. Create a jenkins file
	- Checkout to Github file
	- Build (Nodejs container)
	- Test (Nodejs reusable container)
	- Package (Docker Container)
	- Deploy (Docker resusable container) 

3. Test the above configurations whether they are working or not.

4. Setup Users
	- Admin Users (default created)
	- Test Users (Only have access to test phase)
	- Deploy Users (Only who have access to deploy phase)

5. Check the users access control, whether they are working as expected or not.

6. Create a pipeline:
	- Make sure to notify every step into slack(channel: #jenkins)
	- This pipeline only runs when there is a new commit.
	- private repository should be used in the entire jenkins process.
	- Setup environments for Build, Test, Deploy phases
	- Checkout to git directory
	- make sure to use shared libraries as same repository
	- Build the modules (npm install)
	- Test the modules (npm test) 
	- Create a dockerfile inorder to package the application with required modules (package.json,package.lock.json,...)
	- make sure to include .dockerignore and .gitignore files.
	- Package the application and push to dockerhub repository
	- Deploy this package to Dev Instance, Test Instance
	- Test user can validate this step and approve the check, if the testing fail, then the current commit is reverted from the main branch.
	- Deploy user will be responsible for deploying the application
